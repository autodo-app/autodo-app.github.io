auToDo is now doing a much better job of keeping statistics on your car's refueling history. You can view these stats in the Statistics tab on the home screen, and the stats are used to make sure that notifications for your upcoming ToDo items are delivered on time.

**New Features:**
- [Github Issue](https://github.com/autodo-app/autodo/issues/36): Due Dates are now predicted for mileage-only ToDo items based on driving behavior.
- [Github Issue](https://github.com/autodo-app/autodo/issues/28): The fuel efficiency stat for refueling entries is conditionally shaded based on fuel efficiency history
- [Github Issue](https://github.com/autodo-app/autodo/issues/41): Added content to the Statistics tab on the home screen - currently showing the historical data of fuel efficiency and rate of miles driven per day

**Bugfixes:**
- [Github Issue](https://github.com/autodo-app/autodo/issues/113): fixed bug that made it impossible to create new refuelings with decimal cost or amount values
- [Github Issue](https://github.com/autodo-app/autodo/issues/119): now properly organizing ToDo items with the soonest upcoming item appearing first on the home screen 

This release is available to alpha testers on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jonathanbayless.autodo).
